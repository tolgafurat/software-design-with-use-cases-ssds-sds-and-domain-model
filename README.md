In this document, I designed use cases, system sequence diagrams(ssd), sequence diagrams(sd), domain model and class model for designing a software about:

- Registering items
- Registering customers
- Receiving orders
- Processing these orders

This pdf also contains the GRASP analysis of the software I designed.
